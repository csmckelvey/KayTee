						Hello! My name is Brandi Tiffin. I'm a wife and a mother of 5 beautiful children and I want to welcome you to Kay-Tee Baby Boutique! 
						My family has been fostering for over 5 years and it has helped to show us the true meaning of love and sacrifice. We are so excited, 
						as a family, to be embarking on this new adventure and in turn sharing it with our whole community! 
					</P>

					<P class="spacedBottomBorder">
						This new store is a combination of my dream and the sweat and hard work of all of my family. The store is named after my beautiful friend 
						KatieLady who lost her life earlier this year. The spelling is for my children :) Lady bugs were Katie's favorite and so I'm surrounding my 
						store with her luck and light. I hope to provide each individual with the best shopping experience for them and their little ones each and every visit :) 
					</P>

						I am planning so much for my little store and am looking to fill my shelves with things that everyone can enjoy! I started this store to help 
						out those who can't afford the best new things in life and for those searching for that unique, hard to find item and make it easy! I want to 
						be a part of my customers lives, learn about their needs and emerge myself in what matters most... them. I hope to finish out this year with a 
						bang and I hope I can take you all with me!
					</P>
					<BR />
					<P>
						Thank you for reading, now let's shop!
